Gender pay gap
The gender pay gap or gender wage gap is the average difference between the remuneration for men and women who are working. 
There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: unadjusted versus adjusted pay gap. 
The latter takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience. For example, 
someone who takes time off (e.g. maternity leave) will likely not earn as much as someone who does not take time off from work.
