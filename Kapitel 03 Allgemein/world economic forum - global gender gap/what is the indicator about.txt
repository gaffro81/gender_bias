Indicator
Gender Gap Index:
The report's Gender Gap Index ranks countries according to calculated gender gap between women and men 
in four key areas: health, education, economy and politics to gauge the state of gender equality in a country. 
The report measures women's disadvantage compared to men, and is not strictly a measure of equality. 
Gender imbalances to the advantage of women do not affect the score

So, for example, the indicator "number of years of a female head of state (last 50 years) 
over male value" would score 1 if the number of years was 25, but would still score 1 if the number of years was 50. 
Due to this methodology, gender gaps that favor women over men are reported as equality 
and would not cause deficits of equality in other areas to become less visible in the score, excepted for life expectancy.
